Class Lqueue: It uses a linked list to store the information about whatever it is designed to hold .As a linked list, is uses templated nodes to store data. For this project, the data in every node must be private. You will need to implement normal queue functions such as Push (which inserts in the end), Pop (which removes from front), Display(which displays data in each node), Front(which returns the first element in the queue), Swap (which swaps two nodes), RemoveInsertEnd(which removes a node and moves it to the end), and Clear (which removes all nodes from the lqueue). Finally, you must implement the copy constructor and assignment operator in this class Class comments also include instructions
